## Research Question: Is there a relationship between property turnover and profit from 2015-2021?

### Inspiration
The inspiration for the project originates from the dilemma of wanting the tenants to be happy and stay while wanting to make more money as a business. This is a hard choice for most and most landlords tend to choose one or the other causing them to loose on lots of money with low rents or faced with high expenses through high turnover. The goal of this analysis is to see if there is a relationship and to find an in between that would make tenants stay long while landlords still make more money.

### Takeaways
 - High turnover leads to more $ amount spent on maintenance leading to less profit
 - Best to raise rent closer to market value at renewal while still staying below to give the tenant an incentive to stay
     - This allows us to bring in more revenue while not having the turnover eat up a lot of the extra revenue gained from the higher amount of maintenance request
 - Having back to back turnover will cost more than keeping the rent lower and having the tenant stay longer.

### Conclusion

From the analysis, we have reason to believe that property turnover does affect profit. My goal for this analysis was to understand the best way to maximize revenue while minimizing the amount of maintenance request. The two factors that directly affect that is the rent charged and turnover. By having rent too high at renewal, it can cause the tenants to leave and a turnover to occur. With each turnover, there are many expenses that come with it on both the administrative and maintenance side. Turnover contributes to a high amount of maintenance request for the first year that the tenants live in the home and there are fees charged to find a new tenants for the home. The best way to bypass the turnover to save on the maintenance and administrative expenses is by keeping the rent close to market rent but below enough where it gives the tenant an incentive to stay. This is a win-win for both sides because the turnover will eat up a large amount of the rent gained of being able to rerent at market rent.
